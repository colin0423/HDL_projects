## CircuitFunction_GradeDistribution
PART A:
design function:  
including compare coordination, center of mass, magnitude of the longest side of the triangle, triangle type, and whether the fourth point is in the triangle.
PART B:  
function: simply generate the negative image

## Geofence_IC_contest2021
geofence: This system uses five receivers to construct a virtual fence on a plane and determines whether the target object is inside or outside the fence based on the coordinates of the receivers and the target object.  
This task is from the IC cell-based contest 2021, Taiwan  
## image_AgingPattern_ColorSpaceConversion(synthesized)
This task is a hardware component of an image processor.  
I implemented the timing generator and the main process function.  
timing generator is used to control the time data flow.   
The main processes include aging pattern and color space conversion.  
This hardware design had been synthesized and run through prime time, prime power   
## image_NoiseReduction  
This task is a hardware component of an image processor for noise reduction.
